## Our Mission

The CNCF End User Reference Architecture initiative aims to accelerate cloud native adoption by sharing proven architectural patterns and success stories from the community. We believe in making cloud native technologies more accessible and implementable for organizations at each stage of their journey.

## Why This Matters

### The Cloud Native Landscape

The cloud native ecosystem offers a rich variety of tools and solutions, providing organizations with flexibility in building their technology stack. This diversity enables teams to choose the perfect combination of tools for their specific needs, while benefiting from the innovation and reliability of CNCF projects.

### Community Impact

By sharing proven architectural patterns and real-world implementations, this effort helps organizations:

- Make informed decisions about their cloud native architecture
- Learn from successful implementations
- Accelerate cloud native transformation
- Build confidence in their technology choices

## Our Approach

The [End User Technical Advisory Board (TAB)](https://www.cncf.io/people/end-user-technical-advisory-board/) has established this working group to create practical, actionable resources for the community. The TAB's focus is on delivering real value through:

### Reference Architecture Publication

- Clear, high-level reference architectures aligned with cloud native principles
- Vendor-neutral patterns that showcase best practices
- Practical implementation guidance for common use cases
- Documentation of architectural decisions and their outcomes

### Success Story Platform

Reference architectures provide insight into how organizations have implemented cloud native technologies, including:

- Detailed technical architectures with implementation patterns
- Organizational transformation strategies and outcomes
- Real-world technology stacks and integration approaches
- Technical diagrams illustrating component relationships and system flows

### Community Connection

- A network of organizations actively sharing cloud native experiences
- Direct connections between CNCF member organizations
- Structured communication channels for knowledge exchange
- Opportunities for peer learning and collaboration

## Current Progress

We're proud to showcase initial success stories from:

- [Adobe's architectural evolution](https://architecture.cncf.io/architectures/adobe/)
- [AllianzDirect's cloud native transformation](https://architecture.cncf.io/architectures/allianz/)

These reference architectures demonstrate both the current state of implementations and the journey taken to achieve them.

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions from CNCF member organizations ready to share their cloud native success stories. End user organizations on the TAB are actively contributing examples to help others visualize what's possible.

Check out the [contribution guide](https://architecture.cncf.io/how-to/) to learn more on how you can add to this effort.
