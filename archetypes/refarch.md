<!--

List several projects that are essential to your architecture, how long you've been using it,
and the version you're using it when you drafted your architecture, and a short one or two sentence
description of how it fits in your architecture.

Example:

  {{< card header="Kubernetes" >}}
  [![kubernetes logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/artwork/main/projects/kubernetes/icon/color/kubernetes-icon-color.svg)](https://www.cncf.io/projects/kubernetes/)
  - **Using since:** 2016  
  - **Current version:** 1.31  

  Kubernetes has been a staple in our infrastrucutre. We've upgraded in place and have had a minimal amount of issues in the time that we've used it.The Platform Engineering team is responsible for building a Cloud Native Platform to better serve
in a sustainable way the whole organisation. The team focuses on adopting the best cloud practices
and projects while defining standards and processes for their stakeholders to follow.
